Let the Foldkit Vite plugin mount the installed DevTools overlay automatically. Development dependencies stay out of production builds, while a regular dependency makes `show: 'Always'` sufficient to include the overlay in production. Keep `@foldkit/devtools` in generated applications' development dependencies.

Installing `@foldkit/devtools` is now the whole opt-in: an application that never configured `devTools` gets the overlay in development as soon as the package is present. Set `devTools: false` to turn DevTools off, or uninstall the package to drop the overlay alone.

This removes `DevToolsConfig.overlay`, the `DevToolsOverlay` export from `foldkit/runtime`, and the bare `overlay` export from `@foldkit/devtools`. Remove the overlay import and configuration field when upgrading. The Vite plugin now owns that integration through `@foldkit/devtools/vite`.

Upgrade `foldkit`, `@foldkit/vite-plugin`, and `@foldkit/devtools` together. The plugin injects the overlay only when the installed `@foldkit/devtools` exposes `@foldkit/devtools/vite`, so an older copy skips the overlay instead of failing the build. Thanks @artile for the report.
